# DotnetSimpleApi
This is my first API using Dotnet with the ASP.NET Web Api framework

**Entity Framework version:** 6.2.0

**ASP NET version:** 5.2.7

## observations

1. This project does not inclute the WebConfig, you need to put it by your own
2. In my work environment, we never use the DB first method of entity framework; now I know why, the DB first method makes a mess with the file system of the project. This could be a pain in the ass for developers who do not use VS as code editor
